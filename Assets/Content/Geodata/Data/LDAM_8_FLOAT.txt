DESCRIPTION               = "This data product is an albedo map (brightness)
   of the Moon at a resolution of 3790.42 m/pix by 3790.42 m/pix, true at the 
   equator in cylindrical projection, based on radiometry calulated from 
   data acquired by the LOLA instrument.  The LOLA Laser 1 data from the 
   nominal mission phases are the source for this gridded product.
   
   The ground tracks were interpolated using Generic Mapping Tools programs.
   The map is in the form of a binary table with one row for each
   0.125 degrees of latitude, pixel registered.  

   This label describes an IMG file in the form of a binary resampling
   to pixel registration.
