DESCRIPTION               = "This data product is a shape map (radius)
   of the Moon at a resolution of 1.89521 km/pix by 1.89521 km/pix,
   based on altimetry data acquired through mission phase LRO_ES_52
   by the LOLA instrument. All LOLA data used for the generation of 
   this GDR products are geolocated using precision orbits based on a 
   revised lunar gravity field GRGM 900C[LEMOINEETAL2014].  The previous
   version of this product was generated with data through LRO_ES_21.
   An additional 505,763,339 data points have been added.

   The gridfiles were produced in 45 degree latitude bands, and there 
   may be edge artifacts at this boundary.  Unlike previous versions of
   these products, the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) program 'grdblend' was
   not used.  At higher resolutions, the GMT5.4.2 program 'surface' was
   used to compensate for incomplete coverage. Tension was set to 0.5
   and Anisotropy to 0.5 to minimize latitude distortion. The map is in
   the form of a binary table with one row for each 0.0625 degrees 
   of latitude, pixel registered.  Map values are relative to a radius 
   of 1737.4 km.

   This label describes an IMG file in the form of a binary resampling
   to pixel registration.
